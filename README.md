C projects from first year

These are three small projects that I did in my first year by using C language.

1. Minesweeper

This is a small programme that implements well-known game minesweeper in C. A two dimensional array is used for the
entire board. A structure is used for holding position that user input.

2. Slot machine

This is a small programe implements gambling slot machine in C. Structure is used for holding the three column of the slot machine
and Random number is generated by time seed for generating the result of the machine.

3. Social network

This is a small programe which opens and reads two files. One file is a name list and another file is a novel paragraph.
This programe will search the number of the time that each name from the name list co-occurrencing within 5 lines one by one 
and write all the co-occurence in a .csv file.
This programe used structure array implements linked list in C. Also file stream is used for file read and write.
